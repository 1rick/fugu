# Fugu.tv: Curated Videos for Kids

Fugu.tv is a modest effort to hand pick some youtube channels and playlists that are acceptable for kids to watch. Consider this collection to be suggested guidance, because left on its own, Youtube's autoplay feature can be an unpredictable and potentially dangerous thing for kids. 

**Note**: *I don't recommend that children watch videos smartphones or tablets alone. Watching together as a family, using a TV (Apple TV, Chromecast, or other smart TV options) is my own family's preference.* 

## About the code base

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), forked from user [iRaul's wonderful curated podcasts page](https://github.com/iRaul/podcasts-repo). This is just something for me and friends/family, so I hope it's ok to fork. It's a wonderful little repo he has built. 

If you have video additions to suggest, please see the [contribution guide](about.md).
